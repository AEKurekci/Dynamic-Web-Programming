Bugs: Admin can add empty product writing no information on form. If index.php or any page is opened before firstPage.php web page that creates database, 
any page relevant database cannot be run properly. Firstly, firstPage.php file should run.

Sample Outputs: Sample output screenshots and visual database diagram are under outputs/ directory.
